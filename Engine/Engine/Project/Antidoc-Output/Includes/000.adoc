== Project description

+++This is the library encapsulation for the base software's engine application.+++

+++Common methods, queue references, and event references are stored and accessible via this class. +++

+++This tool also manages event generation on it's encapsulated events/queues+++

+++In the Actor Framework Heirarchy, Engine is located here:+++

+++<b>Actor Framework</b> - Labview COTS Actor Framework library+++

+++<b>Monitored Actor</b> - MGI Actor Monitor toolkit+++

+++<b>Panel Actor</b> - MGI Panel Manager Toolkit+++

+++<b>State Pattern Actor</b> - Labview COTS State Actor Framework library+++

+++<b>Engine</b>  JPL Base Software Framework for all components following the ancestry+++


+++This architecture drastically improves code-reuse, and reduces the amount of labor necessary to create ancestor classes.+++
