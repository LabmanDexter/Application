== Fault Handler.lvlib

*Responsibility:*
+++This tool leverages a fault event generated at the <b>Engine</b> parent level.  +++
+++This fault event reference is passed to all children classes and guarantees that any fault generated by any child is processed here.  +++

+++The tool reads any generated fault event, determines whether it is a warning or failure, and forces the <b>Base</b> GUI to display the fault front end on the bottom of the Main UI.  Errors and warnings are logged into application directory for fault metrics and analytics based on user error or software error.  +++

+++The tool allows users to clear fault and warning conditions, but will re-display if the fault condition has not been resolved.  +++

+++Additionally, the fault tool instructs the main user interface to set its status to Error or Warning as required.  It is the responsibility of the base software to manage responses to these instructions.  Fault Handler is built as a stand-separate packed library so that the source is protected and locked. +++
